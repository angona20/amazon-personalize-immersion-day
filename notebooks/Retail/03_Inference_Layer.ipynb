    "### Cold User Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the key features of Personalize is being able to cold start users. Cold users are typically those who are new to your site or application and cold starting a user is getting from no personalization to making personalized recommendations in real-time. \n",
    "\n",
    "Personalize accomplishes cold starting users via the Event Tracker, just as we saw above with existing users. However, since new users are typically anonymous for a period of time before they create an account or may choose to transact as a guest, personalization is a valuable tool to help convert those anonymous users to transacting users. \n",
    "\n",
    "The challenge here is that Personalize needs a `userId` for anonymous users before it can make personalized recommendations. The Retail Demo Store solves this challenge by creating a provisional user ID the moment an anonymous user first hits the site. This provisional user ID is then used when streaming events to the Event Tracker and when retrieving recommendations from the Recommendations service. This allows the Retail Demo Store to start serving personalized recommendations after the first couple events are streamed to Personalize. Before recommendations can be personalized, Personalize will provide recommendations for popular items as a fallback.\n",
    "\n",
    "To see this behavior in action, browse to the Retail Demo Store storefront using a different browser, an Incognito/Private window, or sign out of your existing account. What you should see on the home page is that instead of **\"Inspired by your shopping behavior\"**, the section is **\"Trending products\"**. After you click on a couple provide detail pages, return to the home page and see that the section title and recommendations have changed. This indicates that recommendations are now being personalized and will continue to become more relevant as you engage with products.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, the category pages will rerank products at first based on popularity and then become more and more personalized.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some challenges with this approach, though. First is the question of what to do with the provisional user ID when the user creates an account. To maintain continuity of the user's interaction history, the Retail Demo Store passes the provisional user ID to the Users microservice when creating a new user account. The Users service then uses this ID as the user's ID going forward. Another challenge is how to handle a user that anonymously browses the site using multiple devices such as on the mobile device and then on a desktop/laptop. In this case, separate provisional user IDs are generated for sessions on each device. However, once the user creates an account on one device and then signs in with that account on the other device, both devices will starting using the same user ID going forward. A side effect here is that the interaction history from one of the devices will be orphaned. This is an acceptable tradeoff given the benefit of cold starting users earlier and is functionally the same UX without this scheme. Additional logic could be added to merge the interaction history from both prior anonymous sessions when the user creates an account. Also, customer data platforms can be used to help manage this for you."
